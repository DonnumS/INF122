At one point i managed to get this working but i messed it up somehow and
can't seem to figure out what i did wrong.

{-
Subset checks if list x is subset of list y. This is used both ways to ensure
that the lists dont have any extra elements that the other list does not have
Then eqli returns True if subset is True for both lists

Probably a way to do this by not making a different function called subset,
but i did not manage to do this

{-
Have not found a way to work in the function that removes letters. Made this to
work around the fact that bracketHelper is not workin when there are letters in
the string. Tried working around it by creating the removeLetters function, but
I did not manage to implement it into sjekk
